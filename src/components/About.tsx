            I'm a React and Tailwind developer with a passion for building
            sleek, responsive UIs. I have a strong grasp of TypeScript for
            scalable and maintainable code, along with Python expertise for
            backend development and automation. Whether it's crafting intuitive
            front-end experiences or streamlining workflows with automation, I
            love solving problems with clean and efficient code.
